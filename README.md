# tes3mp_scriptloader
The script loader makes it much easiser and cleaner to install scripts and remove them. Also, it allows developers to easily test their scripts and develope them without having to modify "core" file IE: serverCore.lua. I'm sorry, I'm absolutely rubbish at writing descriptions.

# Installing
Just place the ``scriptloader.lua`` in your scripts folder and replace the following files in your scripts folder ``serverCore.lua``, ``eventHandler.lua``

# Developing using the script loader
I will put up a wiki any time now to list all of the hooks and how to use them, and how to format your script.

* Garry's Mod - For their Hook system they had, which helped me out.
* 2cwldys - For helping me test.
* [David-AW](https://github.com/David-AW) - Inspiration from his script loader, as well as his scripts.json idea.
