tes3mp_scriptloader
======
The script loader makes it much easier and cleaner to install scripts and remove them. Also, it allows developers to easily test their scripts and develop them without having to modify "core" files IE: serverCore.lua.
I'm sorry, I'm absolutely rubbish at writing descriptions.

Installing
======
Just place the ``scriptloader.lua`` in your scripts folder and replace the following files in your scripts folder ``serverCore.lua``, ``eventHandler.lua``

Develop using the script loader
======
I will put up a wiki any time now to list all of the hooks and how to use them, and how to format your script.

Commits and bug reports.
======
Feel free to commit any changes , but please follow the coding style I used to keep it similar. Please report any bugs you find while using it, and I'll do my best to respond to them and/or fix them.

Coding style
======
* Indents are 4 spaces or a single tab I think?
* lowerCamelCase for local and global variables.
* UpperCamelCase for function names.

Credits
======
* Garry's Mod - For the Hook system they use, which helped me figure out how I was going to do mine.
* 2cwldys - For helping me test.
* [David-AW](https://github.com/David-AW) - Inspiration from his script loader, as well as his scripts.json idea.
