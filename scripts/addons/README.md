Bug-Reporting
======
Feel free to report bugs with any mods here, I'll try my best to fix them at-least until these mods are converted to 0.7.x by the author.

Feature Requests
======
If the mods are not by me then It'd probably be best to request features to be added from the author of the mod themselves, you can find the Github pages of the author right under the "Mod Authors" section.
